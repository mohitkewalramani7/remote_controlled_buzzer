# Title : remote_controlled_buzzer

# Description : 
An Arduino Project that controls the output intensity of a buzzer based on the value entered through a remote control. The values that can be entered are integers on a remote ranging from 0 through 9. A 0 value would indicate no output, A 9 value would indicate maximum output. The corresponding level of output would be the power supplied to the buzzer, which would result in having the sound output of the proportionate intensity. An attached LED would also be lit with proportionate brightness.

The buzzer and LED are connected to pins that allow output of an Analog value, so we can proportionately change the output power to those circuits, as opposed to the binary on/off output.

In addition, when the user chooses a value on the remote, the same value is output to a 1-bit cathode LED, which displays the entered value on the remote on the display. This value starts off as 0. It changes as the user keys in the different integer values from 0 through 9 on the remote control, so the user knows what level the system is currently operating on.
