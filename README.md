# remote_controlled_buzzer
An Arduino Project that controls the output intensity of a buzzer based on the value entered through a remote control. The values that can be entered are integers on a remote ranging from 0 through 9. A 0 value would indicate no output, A 9 value would indicate maximum output. An attached LED would also be lit with proportionate brightness.
